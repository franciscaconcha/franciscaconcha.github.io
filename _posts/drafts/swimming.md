I have never been a good swimmer, but I can swim. I find peace thinking that, in case of a catastrophe in the middle on the sea, I would be able to swim back to safety. Has anybody ever swam half an ocean? I doubt it, and I doubt I would manage, but somehow I have the hope.

I've never liked swimming in the sea. Don't get me wrong, I love the ocean, but I am utterly scared of its vastness and unseen currents. I take a quick dip, jump a few small waves, and go back to the safety of my parasol and beach towel. For swimming, I need the constrained area of a swimming pool.
