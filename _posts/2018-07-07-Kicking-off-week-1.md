The coming week will be the first one of my writing plan, and I'm excited to start! The next two weeks are going to be a bit different from my usual schedule, since I will be Teaching Assistant at the Computational Astrophysics Summer School for undergrad students from Beijing Normal University. I will have to be with the group all through the day from 9h30 to 17h, so my timing will be less flexible than usual. Even so, I managed to make a plan that seems achievable, with four writing blocks for the week (two work ones and two for my science blog).

This week will also be an experiment on how to track my writing habits on my planner. I'm old school and use paper and pen for planning; I've been using a Hobonichi Techo original (size A6) for four years now and I'm absolutely in love with it. There are some column-view month pages that I never use (only for period tracking, when I remember about it) so I intend to track my writing there. It will also give me a nice visual of how consistent I am through the month. For this, I already separated weekdays from weekends (which are not considered in my official writing plan) and set up a color coding system for easier visual tracking:

I also added a temptative timing for each of my writing blocks on the daily pages of my planner:

Usually my daily pages consist of only to-do lists for the day, but for the next two weeks they also hold the schedule for the summer school, which is why there is a bit more time tracking. I intend to keep writing down the blocks with this system, though.

I normally do this week planning on Sundays, but tomorrow I'm a bit busy so I decided to finish it today. I expect to do a especial post dedicated to my planning system and how I get organized for each week.

At the end of this week I will update about my progress. Let's see how it goes!
