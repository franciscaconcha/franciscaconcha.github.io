I am a **PhD Candidate** in the **Computational Astrophysics** group (CAstLe) at Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, under the supervision of Simon Portegies Zwart. I got my **B.Sc. in Astronomy** (2013) and **M.Sc. in Computer Science** (2016) degrees at Universidad de Chile. My research interests include the evolution of young star clusters, the dynamical interactions of protoplanetary disks inside open clusters, and the formation of the Solar System. In computer science, my research interests are GPU optimization and geometrical mesh applications.
