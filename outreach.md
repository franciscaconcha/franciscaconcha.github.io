# Outreach & writing
  
## Primer Fotón
Since June 2015 I run a blog in Spanish called <a href="http://primerfoton.cl" target="_blank">Primer Fotón</a>, which in English means First Photon. I cover the subjects of astronomy and computer science and it is aimed to the general public, focusing on simple explanations of phenomena and scientific developments. Primer Fotón is part of <a href="http://redlcc.org" target="_blank">Red Latinoamericana de Cultura Científica</a>, Latinamerican Network of Scientific Culture, a plataform for latin american bloggers working on science outreach. Since October 2016 I am also part of the directory of the Network.
I have also been developing a <a href="http://us.ivoox.com/es/podcast-podcast-primer-foton_sq_f1255983_1.html" target="_blank">Primer Fotón podcast</a>, where I comment different astronomical news.

## Astronomy on Tap Leiden
A few months after starting my PhD in Leiden I became part of the group organizing <a href="http://astronomyontap.org" target="_blank">Astronomy on Tap</a> events in our town. Astronomy on Tap is an outeach initiative started in New York in 2013 that brings professional scientists to local bars to share their knowledge with the public. Together with an amazing group of people, we bring <a href="http://astronomyontap.nl" target="_blank">Astronomy on Tap Leiden</a> the last Monday of every month to Grand Café de Burcht in the city center.

## Observatorio Astronómico Andino
From September 2012 to August 2016 I was an astronomer at <a href="http://oaa.cl" target="_blank">Observatorio Astronómico Andino</a>, a beautiful touristic astronomical observatory close to Santiago de Chile. There I had the chance to give astronomy talks to all kinds of people, ranging from middle school kids to Chile's former president, Michelle Bachelet. The tour consisted in an introductory talk about astronomical objects, looking at the sky with naked eye and learning to recognize constellations and other properties such as the color of the stars, and then observations with binoculars and telescopes up to 14" in size. We also performed demonstrations of astrophotography, and you can see some of my (very amateur) images <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/astrofran/sets/72157651298918207/" target="_blank">here</a>. Working at the OAA was a very important step in realizing how amazing it is to share astronomy with the public.

## Escéptica
My beginning as a science writer was on <a href="http://esceptica.org" target="_blank">Escéptica</a>, the Spanish version of <a href="http://skepchick.org" target="_blank">Skepchick</a>. From August 2011 to February 2012 I collaborated with a few articles in Spanish, spanning different subjects (strangely so, not astronomy). These are not my best articles but they hold a dear place in my heart, since they were the first ones I ever published. You can see my articles on Escéptica <a href="http://esceptica.org/author/fractalica/" target="_blank">here</a>.
