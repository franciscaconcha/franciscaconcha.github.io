# Current PhD research

## Circumstellar disks inside young star clusters

Most stars form in clustered environments, high in both stellar and gas densities. These are also the surroundings where circumstellar disks form, soon after star formation. The hostile environments during the first millions years of evolution of star forming regions can dramatically affect the evolution of the circumstellar disks: they might get truncated by dynamical interactions with other nearby stars, they might get stripped off of their material due to the ram pressure of the gas that surrounds them, they might get evaporated due to the intense radiation from their host or neighbouring stars, among other processes. The disks also present internal viscous evolution, which leads them to grow through time. Some of these physical processes are probably more dominant than others, affecting the evolution of circumstellar disks more strongly. Also, different mechanisms may dominate during different stages of the evolution of the disks. Understanding the processes that occur inside star forming regions and young star clusters helps us understand circumstellar disks and, therefore, planetary formation.

The research I'm currently carrying out during my PhD looks to anwser many questions, among them: what are the main mechanisms affecting the evolution of circumstellar disks around stars in young clusters? From this, I also look to get insights about how our Solar System was formed. The way in which I am trying to tackle this problem is through the use of computational simulations. I run simulations of young stellar clusters using <a href="http://amusecode.org" target="_blank">AMUSE</a>, the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment, a community effort being developed in part by the Computational Astrophysics group at Leiden Observatory under supervision of Simon Portegies Zwart. In these simulations I consider the different processes that might be affecting the evolution of the circumstellar disks, and then analyze the resulting size distributions of the disks and other characteristics of the cluster.

We are lucky to be living in an era where we have powerful telescopes looking at the sky. Nowadays, thanks to enormous observational installations such as ALMA, it is possible to observe circumstellar disks inside their formation environments. Comparing these observations against simulation results offers an invaluable standard to measure if our simulations' assumptions are leading us in the right direction.

# Research for my M.Sc. in Computer Science
Astronomy is a data-intensive discipline, where Terabytes of information are being produced around the world every night. Quick processing and analysis of said data is crucial for the development of scientific results. Because of this, the pipelines of data processing tools for astronomy are beginning to embrace Big Data paradigms. However, hardware-wise, there are also ways to accelerate algorithms for data analysis.

During my Master's program in Computer Science I developed a tool for astronomical data reduction and photometry obtention using GPU-accelerated algorithms. The GPU is the Graphics Processing Unit of a computer, and in the last decades the use of GPUs for accelerating mathematical calculations has become standard in many data-intensive areas. The design of the GPU allows for many calculations to be carried out in parallel, thus accelerating the execution times of algorithms sometimes for factors of two orders of magnitude, compared to their CPU counterparts.

However, designing data-intensive algorithms for the GPU is not straight-forward. You cannot just run your CPU scripts on a GPU, the whole problem needs to be re-thought and re-designed to take advantage of the GPU's hardware.

My thesis (in English, with abstract in Spanish) is available <a href="http://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/140769" target="_blank">here</a>.
